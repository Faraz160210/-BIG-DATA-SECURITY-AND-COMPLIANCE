*DESCRIPTION*

This Python framework simulates big data security and compliance. It logs data access, encrypts data, and tracks breaches. Data sources are cataloged with sensitivity levels. Audit and breach reports are generated. It demonstrates core security concepts, though real-world systems require robust tools.




Data Catalog: The data_catalog dictionary simulates a data inventory, storing information about data sources and their sensitivity.

Encryption: The encrypt_data method uses a simple hashing algorithm (SHA-256) for demonstration. In a real system, use robust encryption libraries.

Access Logging: The access_data method logs data access events, simulating audit trails.

Data Breach Logging: The data_breach method logs data breach events.

Audit Reports: The generate_audit_report method generates a basic audit report.

Breach Reports: The generate_breach_report method generates a basic breach report.

Key Management: The encryption_keys dictionary simulates basic key management.

Data sensitivity: The code now has the ability to store data sensitivity.

*Important Notes*:

This is a simplified example. Real-world big data security and compliance require comprehensive solutions and specialized tools.
For production systems, use established security libraries and services.
Implement proper access control mechanisms, intrusion detection, and vulnerability management.
This example does not implement any compliance checking, which would be extremely complex.
This example does not implement data masking or anonymization.
